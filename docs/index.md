Workers.coop Documentation
==========================

Documentation for the website and services that are maintained for
[workers.coop](https://workers.coop).

This site has been built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and can be
updated via
[git.coop](https://git.coop/workers/docs#workerscoop-documentation).

If you would like to contribute to this documentation project but using `git`
sounds far too technical then please use the Nextcloud text editor at
[office.workers.coop](https://office.workers.coop/) to create documentaion
pages and then contact the [Digital Infrastructure
Group](https://forum.workers.coop/c/general/digital/7) to let them know the URL
of the file(s) you have created and ask them to add them to this project for
you.

The documentation is divided into three sections, members, administrators and
system administrators.
