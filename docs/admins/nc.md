Nextcloud and ONLYOFFICE
========================

Group Folders
-------------

See the [thread from Liam](https://forum.workers.coop/t/group-folders-in-nextcloud/497):

> We’ve got Group Folders setup within Nextcloud, so that there is no need to share a link with someone of the same group as you, providing you’ve put the file within the Group Folder of the group you belong to.
>
> For example, I’m a member of the Digital Infrastructure group, should @chris wish to share a document or folder with me, he need only put that content in the Group Folder and I will have access to it. (See screenshot for what the folder looks like)

> You’ll find the Group Folder on the main file list when you login.

> Obviously if you need to share a specific file or folder with someone, or provide a public link, you can do so using the share functionality, but please don’t share a document, folder or share that has already been shared.
